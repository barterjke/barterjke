# C++ is ok
## By Barter
we are great
Let's play this little game
```
#lang:cpp
#include <iostream>  
void sum(int a, int b) {   
    return a + b;
}
```
here is one liner: `#lang:cpp void sum(int a, int b) { return a + b }`;
`#lang:bash echo true`

booo boo
I want you to **ask** yourself an honest question. When was the last time you actually had _fun_ in programming? Looking back, I don't think I've actually had fun in programming for close to...10 years? I don't have fun with JavaScript, Python, Ruby, C, nothing. When I say "fun" I mean, you genuinely were excited to work on your project and the whole time you work on it you're thinking, "Damn this is a blast. I can't believe that wild idea I had actually worked!
hey brothers!
all of that will be ommitted
