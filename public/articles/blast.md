I want you to **ask** yourself an honest question. When was the last time you actually had _fun_ in programming? Looking back, I don't think I've actually had fun in programming for close to...10 years? I don't have fun with JavaScript, Python, Ruby, C, nothing. When I say "fun" I mean, you genuinely were excited to work on your project and the whole time you work on it you're thinking, "Damn this is a blast. I can't believe that wild idea I had actually worked!
